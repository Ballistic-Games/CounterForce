            Players are the most important thing on the map, for obvious reasons, Tapping on a player icon will open a player information window, like this one:
        </p>
        <img src="PlayerLegend.png" alt="Player_Legend"  style="width:328px;height:428px;align-items:center;margin-top:0px;">
        <p id="most">
            Most of the information on this window is easy to understand, but let's go through some of the more mysterious bits:
        </p>
        <div2>
        <p id="long_list">
            <ol>
               1) Alliance name. This player is a member of the alliance "Dancing with The Devil."
            </ol>
            <ol>
                2) This icon means the plaer is a leader in their alliance. (This blue peace icon and the blue around the profile picture means this player is in an alliance that is at peace with yours.
                Red means you are at war, cyan means they are in your alliance, and purple means you have a pending treaty with their alliance or they are joining your alliance.)
             </ol>
             <ol>
                3) Relative Value Multiplier. This is an indication of how powerful this player is compared to you. In this case, Emotional Damage is 4.58 times more powerful than we are.
